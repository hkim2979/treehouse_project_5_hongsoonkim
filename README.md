## Overview
This is a front-end web development project 4 for Treehouse Techdegree. The big deal about this project is not the way it looks but what is behind it. The CSS used in this project was generated into a single file using the Sass Preprocessor. Sass lets the code break up the files into smaller chunks so it is easier to stay organized when you are working on a large project. Also all of the repetitive codes were asked to simplify into few simple codes. Using "&" symbol, mixins etc were all required on this project as well.
 
 ## Skills
- SASS/SCSS

## Conclusion
I had better understanding of using SCSS to organize complex CSS file.
